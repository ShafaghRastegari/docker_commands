       "First, you need to create a Docker volume. Docker volumes are directories that are shared between the host system \n",
       "and Docker containers. You can create a volume using the `docker volume create` command:\n",
       "\n",
       "```bash\n",
       "docker volume create config-volume\n",
       "```\n",

       "\n",
       "Next, you'll run a Docker container and mount the volume you just created to a directory inside the container where\n",
       "the configuration files are expected to be. For example, if you're running an Nginx container and want to manage \n",
       "its configuration files, you might mount the volume to `\u001b[35m/etc/nginx/conf.d/\u001b[0m` inside the container.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's an example command:\n",
       "\n",
       "```bash\n",
       "docker run -d --name my-nginx \\\n",
       "  -v config-volume:\u001b[35m/etc/nginx/conf.d/\u001b[0m \\\n",

       "  nginx:latest\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "This command does the following:\n",
       "- `-d` runs the container in detached mode.\n",
       "- `--name my-nginx` names your container `my-nginx`.\n",
       "- `-v config-volume:\u001b[35m/etc/nginx/conf.d/\u001b[0m` mounts the `config-volume` volume to `\u001b[35m/etc/nginx/conf.d/\u001b[0m` inside the \n",
       "container.\n",
       "- `-p \u001b[1;92m8080:80\u001b[0m` maps port \u001b[1;36m8080\u001b[0m on the host to port \u001b[1;36m80\u001b[0m inside the container.\n",
       "- `nginx:latest` specifies the image to use for the container.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Step \u001b[1;36m3\u001b[0m: Managing Configuration Files\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, you can manage your Nginx configuration files by adding or modifying files in the volume. To do this, you'll \n",
       "need to know where the volume's data is stored on your host system. You can find the volume's path using:\n",
       "\n",
       "```bash\n",
       "docker volume inspect config-volume\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "Look for the `Mountpoint` field in the output. This is where your configuration files are stored on the host \n",
       "system. You can now add, edit, or remove configuration files in this directory, and the changes will be reflected \n",
       "inside the container.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Note\n",
       "\n",
       "- When you update configuration files, you might need to restart your container for the changes to take effect, \n",
       "depending on how the application inside the container handles configuration updates.\n",
       "- Docker volumes persist even after you stop or remove containers that use them. If you want to remove a volume, \n",
       "you can do so with `docker volume rm config-volume`, but be cautious as this will delete all data stored in the \n",
       "volume.\n",
       "\n",
       "Using volumes for configuration files is a powerful way to manage your containers' configurations, making it easier\n",

       "\n",
       "```bash\n",
       "docker network disconnect \u001b[1m[\u001b[0mOPTIONS\u001b[1m]\u001b[0m NETWORK CONTAINER\n",

       "\n",
       "Here's a breakdown of the components of this command:\n",
       "\n",
       "- `\u001b[1m[\u001b[0mOPTIONS\u001b[1m]\u001b[0m`: This allows you to specify additional options to customize the command's behavior. For disconnecting\n",

       "Let's say you have a Docker network named `my-network` and a container named `my-container` connected to this \n",

       "- Disconnecting a container from a network might affect the functionality or accessibility of services running \n",

       "- If you're working in a production environment, make sure to assess the impact of disconnecting a container from a\n",
       "network before performing the action.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "**Creating a Docker Secret**\n",
       "---------------------------\n",
       "\n",
       "To create a Docker Secret, use the `docker secret create` command:\n",
       "```bash\n",
       "echo <span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">\"my_secret_password\"</span> | docker secret create my_secret -\n",
       "```\n",
       "This command creates a new secret named `my_secret` with the value `my_secret_password`.\n",

       "**Listing Docker Secrets**\n",
       "-------------------------\n",

       "**Mounting Docker Secrets as Environment Variables**\n",
       "-------------------------------------------------\n",
       "\n",
       "To mount a Docker Secret as an environment variable, use the `--env` flag:\n",

       "is usually located at `\u001b[35m/etc/docker/\u001b[0m\u001b[95mdaemon.json\u001b[0m` on Linux systems.\n",

       "\n",
       "```bash\n",
       "docker kill \u001b[1m[\u001b[0mOPTIONS\u001b[1m]\u001b[0m CONTAINER \u001b[1m[\u001b[0mCONTAINER\u001b[33m...\u001b[0m\u001b[1m]\u001b[0m\n",

       "terminates the container. However, you can specify a different signal to allow the container to exit gracefully. \n",
       "For example, `SIGTERM` \u001b[1m(\u001b[0mor `\u001b[1;36m15\u001b[0m`\u001b[1m)\u001b[0m is often used to request a termination, allowing the container process to clean up\n",
       "before exiting.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Example:\n",
